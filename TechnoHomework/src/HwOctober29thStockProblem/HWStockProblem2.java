		   //    Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
//	    Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
	//
//	    Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
	//
//	    Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
	//
//	    Example 2:
	//
//	    Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
//	    Output: 4
//	    Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
//	    Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
//	    engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
//
